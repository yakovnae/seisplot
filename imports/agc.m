% AGC Automatic Gain Control for geophysical images
%
% Usage: agcim = agc(im, sigma, p, r)
%
% Arguments:    im - The input image.  NaNs in the image are handled
%                    automatically. 
%            sigma - The standard deviation of the Gaussian filter used to
%                    determine local image mean values and to perform the
%                    summation used to determine the local gain values.
%                    Sigma is specified in pixels, try experimenting with a
%                    wide range of values. 
%                p - The power used to compute the p-norm of the local image
%                    region. The gain is obtained from the p-norm.  If
%                    unspecified its value defaults to 2 and r defaults to 0.5
%                r - Normally r = 1/p (and it defaults to this) but it can
%                    specified separately to achieve specific results.  See
%                    Rajagopalan's papers.
%
% Returns:   agcim - The Automatic Gain Controlled image.
%
% The algorithm is based on Shanti Rajagopalan's papers, referenced below, with
% a couple of differences.
%
% 1) The gain is computed from the difference between the image and its local
% mean.  The aim of this is to avoid any local base-level issues and to allow
% the code to be applied to a wide range of image types, not just magnetic
% gradient data.  The gain is applied to the difference between the image and
% its local mean to obtain the final AGC image.
%
% 2) The computation of the local mean and the summation operations used to
% compute the local gain is performed using Gaussian smoothing.  The aim of this
% is to avoid abrupt changes in gain as the summation window is moved across the
% image.  The effective window size is controlled by the value of sigma used to
% specify the Gaussian filter.
